# Grading

## How to loss 1 point per file per issue

-   Header comment block missing - need to provide your name, date, class, and a
    short description. Optional items can be the assignment text block
-   Class comment block missing - Every public class in the code needs to have a
    comment block talking about what the class does. What is the class' job.
-   Non-private method comment block missing - Every non-public method in the
    code needs to have a comment block that has a short description of what the
    method does, what are the inputs/parameters, what does the method return, and
    what exceptions it might throw.
-   Failure to submit a project. In other words, only the code was passed in.
-   File is not formatted.

## How to loss partial points for a particular problem

-   The code crashes during run time. Except when the assignment is to do so.
-   Not using the concepts that were presented for that week. Using advanced/future
    topics instead of the current topic does not count.

## How to loss all the points for a particular problem

-   Code is missing or not there. If you create a class file and all it has is
    the class with no other methods or code, no points.
-   Presenting code that does not do what is asked for.
-   submitting .class files instead of the .java files. The .java files are the
    text files that we read and code in. The .class files is the compiled code that
    the computer reads, I can not read this file. I am unable to read .class files
    and so, I am unable to grade the assignment.
-   Code does not compile
-   Code is not in a project.
-   File name does not match class name (i.e. code does not compile)
