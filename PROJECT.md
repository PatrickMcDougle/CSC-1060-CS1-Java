# Project

The project will be a learning system.

## You Must Implement

1.  UI interface.
    -   We have been making and dealing with UI all semester long.
        Now, it's time to take it to the next level.
    -   Make it user-friendly and readable.
    -   Console-based UI only.
    -   NO graphic UI (no AWT, no Swing, no JavaFX)
2.  The user can select these things from the UI to get more information about them.
    -   ASCII Table
        -   Generate a readable table. Some ASCII characters will mess up
            formatting or are not visible. Make the non-displayable characters
            displayable.
    -   Truth table of Java operations.
        -   Show a truth table and how different values with different operations
            work.
    -   Bit manipulation
        -   Show an example of how bit manipulation works in Java.
        -   Generate a static table
        -   Generate random examples.
    -   Sudoku Board
        -   9x9 board.
        -   Randomly add numbers to the board.
            -   The random board must pass one of the checks below.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in the rows are valid.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in the column are valid.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in a 3x3 square are valid.
3.  Something based on your Research topic.

## You Must Research

Research something about Java. You may pick from the list below or come up with
your own ideas. Once you have researched, you must implement something that
shows off what you have learned/researched.

-   ASCII text art
-   ASCII text maze
-   Search Algorithms
-   Sorting Algorithms
-   Password storage
-   Prime Number Algorithms
-   Matrix Calculations
-   Vector - addition, subtraction, equality
-   Great-Circle distance

If you choose an idea not on this list, you must get the instructor's permission
to work on it.

## Requirements

-   The project shall be written in Java
-   The project shall NOT have a GUI interface.
-   The project shall have a console window and text UI.
-   The Individual/Group shall research and implement something that applies to
    the project.
-   The project must implement what is listed above.
