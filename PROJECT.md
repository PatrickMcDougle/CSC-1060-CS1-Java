# Project

The project will be a learning system.

## You Must Implement

1.  UI interface.
    -   We have been making and dealing with UI all semester long.
        Now its time to take it to the next level.
    -   Make it user friendly and readable.
2.  Things the user can select from the UI to get more information about.
    -   ASCII Table
        -   generate a readable table. Some ASCII characters will mess up
            formatting or are not visible. Make the non-displayable characters
            displayable.
    -   Truth table of Java operations.
        -   show a truth table and how different values with different operations
            work.
    -   bit manipulation
        -   show example of how bit manipulation works in Java.
        -   generate a static table
        -   generate random examples.
    -   Sudoku Board
        -   9x9 board.
        -   Randomly add numbers to the board.
            -   The random board must past one of the checks below.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in the rows are valid.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in the column are valid.
        -   Make a method that checks the numbers in a 3x3 square are valid.

## You Must Research

Research something about Java. You may pick from the list below, or come up
with some ideas of your own. Once researched, you must implement something
that shows off what you have learned/researched.

-   ASCII text art
-   ASCII text maze
-   Search Algorithms
-   Sorting Algorithms
-   Password storage
-   Prime Number Algorithms
-   Matrix Calculations
-   Vector - addition, subtraction, equality
-   Great-Circle distance

If you pick an idea that is not on this list, you must get the instructor's
permission to work on it.

## Requirements

-   The project shall be written in Java
-   The project shall NOT have a GUI interface.
-   The project shall have a console window and text UI.
-   The Individual/Group shall research something that applies to the project
    and implement it.
